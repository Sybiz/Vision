# Vision
The samples contained within this repository will guide you in relation to example uses of breakpoints, the platform, some reporting concepts, as well as the Web API.
The repository will be built on over time as more ideas and situations are presented to us, that may be valuable to present as a sample.

## Installation
Please note that the Vision software needs to be installed; a download link can be provided for installation. Licensing must also occur, once a common database has been created in the desktop application, a license file will be provided for import.
The database must be installed on an SQL server and does not support LocalDB at this time.

## BreakpointSamples
Broken into some major categories, these provide examples of some breakpoint functionality, including some generic solutions to real world problems.
Please note that samples are not intended 'as is' for client installation, and it is inevitable that even if a sample provides a solution to a client problem, that tweaking of the sample will be required to cater for the specific scenario.
New to 23.00 is the "BreakpointHelpers" class, and many of the samples included highlight many of the class's uses.

## PlatformSamples
Provides an example project, demonstrating usage of the Platform. Further information can be found in the folder's specific README.

## ReportSamples
Contains example .repx files, highlighting particular concepts that may be of interest to some people.
Please note the specific README in that folder for installation instructions

## WebAPISamples
Contains basic examples and documentation of how to use the Vision REST based API.
